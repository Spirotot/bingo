Bingo Card Generator
====================

Some terrible old code I wrote that belongs on the Internet.

Just dump your potential bingo terms into a text file, each on its own line, run the program, and print out the resulting HTML. Pagebreaks, etc. *should* be handled gracefully.

Usage:
------

```shell
bingo-generator.py  [file of terms] [output file] [# of cards]
```

Example:
--------

```shell
python bingo-generator.py bingo_terms.txt bingo.html 20
```
